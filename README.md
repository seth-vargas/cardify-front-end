# Cardify Frontend

Cardify is a simple and minimalistic note-taking application built using React and styled with Bootstrap. I felt motivated to create an application designed to help people learn and share what they have learned together! This application is far from completed and is ***very*** far from perfect, so if you have any comments or pointers feel free to let me know!

## Getting Started

This app is currently not deployed, but I plan to do so very soon!

In the mean time, to get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **yarn**

    ```sh
        npm install --global yarn
    ```

- **tmux**: While this may not be ***absolutely*** required, it does make the process a whole lot easier! Or I think it does personally. I'm sure you can just create another terminal window to run both the server and vite. You can read more about it [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/tmux-tutorial-install-commands). If you get too overwhelmed or confused (been there, done that) just open another terminal window for the backend server and move on!

### Installation - Frontend Only

Please refer to the [backend repository](https://github.com/seth-vargas/cardify-back-end.git) as well as this repository for full installation instructions.

1. Create a new directory to hold both the backend and frontend

    ```sh
        mkdir cardify
    ```

2. Navigate to that new directory now!

    ```sh
        cd cardify
    ```

4. Clone the frontend repo

    ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/seth-vargas/cardify-front-end.git
    ```

5. cd to front-end

    ```sh
        cd front-end
    ```

6. Install the packages for the frontend repo

    ```sh
        yarn
    ```

9. Run developer mode using yarn

    ```sh
        yarn dev
    ```
